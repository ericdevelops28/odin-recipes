            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a pan, heat butter and oil, then add garlic and cook them lightly and avoid burning them.</li>
            <li>Then add your soy sauce, honey and lemon juice to the pan.</li>
            <li>Now that you've cooked your garlic and added your sauces, its time to place the fillets, (skin side down if you have fillets with skin) and cook them for about 4-5 min per side on low to medium.</li>
            <li>While the salmon cooks, use a spoon to baste the salmon with the sauce that we added.</li>
            <li>Keep adding the sauce, and feel free to add more honey if you prefer a sweeter taste!</li>
            <li>Once you've cooked both sides for about 4-5 min, your fillets should be ready to serve!</li>
